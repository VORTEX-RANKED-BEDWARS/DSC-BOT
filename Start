Discord AutoRole Bot
====================

Files:
- `bot.py`: Discord bot code. Loads config from environment, handles autorole, welcome embeds, automod, moderation slash commands, and the ticket/support system.
- `requirements.txt`: Python dependencies (`discord.py` and `python-dotenv`).
- `.env.example`: Copy to `.env`, fill in the bot token, keep the provided guild/role IDs, optionally set a welcome channel, point to the support channel for the ticket panel, and define the support-team role that manages tickets.

Running locally:
1. `python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate`
2. `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. `cp .env.example .env` and set `DISCORD_TOKEN` to your bot token (this file intentionally ships without one). (Optional) set `DISCORD_WELCOME_CHANNEL_ID`, configure `DISCORD_SUPPORT_CHANNEL_ID` to the text channel where you want the ticket panel, and set `DISCORD_SUPPORT_TEAM_ROLE_ID` to the role that should see and manage every ticket thread.
4. `python bot.py`

The bot automatically runs in guild `1443680950952394784`, assigns role `1444126866746245253`, posts a rich welcome embed (with avatar + member number), and maintains a persistent ticket panel in support channel `1444126841811112006`. The panel now offers dropdown choices for General, Partner, Report, Staff, Creator, and Builder requests, plus a button for quick staff/creator apps. Auto-moderation removes slurs/profanity (e.g. nga/n1gga/n!gger/retard/fucking) and records warnings. Moderation & ticket management are handled via slash commands: `/autorole_refresh`, `/ban`, `/kick`, `/mute`, `/warn`, `/warnings`, `/ticket_claim`, and `/ticket_close` (all scoped to the configured guild). Support-team members (role `DISCORD_SUPPORT_TEAM_ROLE_ID`) are auto-added to every ticket thread so they can collaborate. Enable the Message Content intent for the bot in the Discord Developer Portal so automod and commands can inspect messages.
