Discord AutoRole Bot
====================

Files:
- `bot.py`: Discord bot code. Loads config from environment, handles autorole, welcome embeds, automod, moderation slash commands, and the ticket/support system.
- `requirements.txt`: Python dependencies (`discord.py` and `python-dotenv`).
- `.env.example`: Copy to `.env`, fill in the bot token, keep the provided guild/role IDs, optionally set a welcome channel, and point to the support channel for the ticket panel.

Running locally:
1. `python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate`
2. `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. `cp .env.example .env` and set `DISCORD_TOKEN` to your bot token (this file intentionally ships without one). (Optional) set `DISCORD_WELCOME_CHANNEL_ID`, and configure `DISCORD_SUPPORT_CHANNEL_ID` to the text channel where you want the ticket panel.
4. `python bot.py`

The bot automatically runs in guild `1443680950952394784`, assigns role `1444126866746245253`, posts a rich welcome embed (with avatar + member number), and maintains a persistent ticket panel in support channel `1444126841811112006`. The panel includes dropdown + button workflows for General, Partner, Report, and Application tickets with modals collecting professional details. Auto-moderation removes slurs/profanity (e.g. nga/n1gga/n!gger/retard/fucking) and records warnings. Moderation is handled via slash commands: `/autorole_refresh`, `/ban`, `/kick`, `/mute`, `/warn`, and `/warnings` (all scoped to the configured guild). Use `/autorole_refresh` (manage_roles permission required) to reapply the autorole to all members. Ensure the Message Content intent is enabled for the bot in the Discord Developer Portal so automod and commands can inspect messages.
